## INTERNSHIPS
-	Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) DKI Group Research Intern					2020.11-2021.05
	- Interests: Deep learning in computer vision and graphics (Mentor: Shizhao Sun, Jian-Guang Lou)
		- Design Improvement: AesChecker, which suggests aesthetic improvement especially for slides, takes an existing visualization as the input and generating a refined version with the improved aesthetic quality as the output. It includes a design principle-guided candidate generation stage and a data-driven candidate evaluation stage. My contributions are design and implementation of Balance which is the most important principle, and feature engineering, training and optimization for annotated data and evaluation models.
		- Hierarchy-Aware Generation: To handle the hierarchical characteristic, we factor the layout generation process into two stages. The first stage predicts representations for regions and the second stage generates detailed placement for each element based on predicted region representations. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the methods ignoring these characteristics, especially on complex graphic layouts. My contribution is implementation of experiments including baseline, models and evaluation.
	- Achievementsï¼šVIS2021 submitted, ICCV2021 submitted, Microsoft product evaluation
-	HIT Massive Data Computing Center Research Assistant						2020.05-
	- Interests: Deep learning in knowledge graph embedding (Mentor: Prof. Hongzhi Wang)
	- RandomResidualGCN: To improve embedding quality in knowledge graph, pre-training has been proved effective, which has popular two branches. One uses GCN with 2 layers, and another one uses graph attention. We propose an approach for filling the gap that capture little neighbor information with GCNs and weaker performance than the first one with graph attention. My contributions are writing parts of papers and implementation of experiments.
