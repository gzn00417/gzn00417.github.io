## Welcome to [Zhuoning Guo (郭茁宁)](https://gzn00417.github.io/) 's homepage!

I am currently a $4^{th}$-year Ph.D. student at [AI Thrust](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/information-hub/artificial-intelligence/), [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Xiaowen Chu](https://sites.google.com/view/chuxiaowen) and [Prof. Renjing Xu](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page?id=97). I received my bachelor degree of software engineering from [Computing Faculty](http://cs.hit.edu.cn/), [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/) in 2022. My current research interests include multimodal LLM, information retrieval, and video understanding.

Now, I am a research intern at [NLP Group](https://huggingface.co/Alibaba-NLP), [Tongyi Lab](https://tongyi.aliyun.com), [Alibaba Group](https://www.alibabagroup.com/). Previously, I was a visiting student at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/). Before starting my Ph.D. career, I was a research intern at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/) and [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/) in the third and final year of undergraduate period.

For my coding passions, I spent years on [National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI)](https://www.noi.cn/) and won 2 First Prize in Fujian Province (2014 & 2016) during junior and senior high schools. With the help of these awards, I am honor to obtain early admission from Independent Recruitment of HIT in 2018.

See my [curriculum vitae page](https://gzn00417.github.io/cv/) or [pdf file](https://gzn00417.github.io/files/CV-GuoZhuoning-20250509.pdf) for more information.


<!-- # Looking for Opportunities
> **<span style="color:red"> I expect to graduate at 2026 Fall or 2027 Spring. I will be open to full-time industrial researcher and research intern from 2026 Spring. If you have opportunities, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you! </span>** -->
