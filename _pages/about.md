Welcome to Zhuoning Guo's homepage!

I'm an undergraduate at [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/) from 2018, majoring in Software Engineering. I was a research intern at DKI Group, [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/) supervised by _Shizhao Sun_, and a research assistant at [HIT-DBLab](http://cs.hit.edu.cn/2018/1126/c11289a218419/page.htm) supervised by _Hongzhi Wang_.

Currently, I'm looking for research internship and Ph.D. position.

Here is my latest [curriculum vitae](https://gzn00417.github.io/cv/).
