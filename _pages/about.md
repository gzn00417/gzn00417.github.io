Welcome to Zhuoning Guo (郭茁宁) 's homepage!

I'm an incoming Ph.D. student at AI Thrust, Information Hub, [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou Campus)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Hao Liu](https://raymondhliu.github.io/). HKUST(GZ) is a new campus of [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) rather than an independent university, which is located in Guangzhou, China, and focusing on interdisciplinary research. Before that, I’m currently a final-year undergraduate of [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/), majoring in Software Engineering, at [Computing Faculty](http://cs.hit.edu.cn/). My research interests includes data mining, graph learning and urban computing.

 Recently, I join [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/) as a research intern, supervised by [Hengshu Zhu](https://www.zhuhengshu.com/). I was a research intern at DKI Group, [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/) supervised by [Dr. Shizhao Sun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E8%AF%97%E6%98%AD-%E5%AD%99-771b42141/), and a research assistant at [HIT-DBLab](http://cs.hit.edu.cn/2018/1126/c11289a218419/page.htm) supervised by [Prof. Hongzhi Wang](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wang).

Besides study, I'm honored as the chairman of [HIT Massive Data Club](http://cs.hit.edu.cn/hlsjjlb/list.htm), captain of Football Team of Computing Faculty, HIT and president of HIT Chess Club.

Here is my latest [curriculum vitae](https://gzn00417.github.io/cv/).
