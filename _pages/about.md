## Welcome to [Zhuoning Guo (郭茁宁)](https://gzn00417.github.io/) 's homepage!

I'm currently a $3^{rd}$-year Ph.D. student at [Information Hub](https://infh.hkust-gz.edu.cn/en), [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/). I received my bachelor degree of software engineering from [Computing Faculty](http://cs.hit.edu.cn/), [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/) in 2022. My current research interests include representation learning, multimodal LLM, information retrieval.

Now, I'm a research intern at [NLP Group](https://huggingface.co/Alibaba-NLP), [Tongyi Lab](https://tongyi.aliyun.com), [Alibaba](https://www.alibabagroup.com/). Previously, I was a visiting student at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). Before starting my Ph.D. career, I was a research intern at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/) and [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/) in the third and final year of undergraduate period.

For my coding passions, I spent years on [National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI)](https://www.noi.cn/) and won 2 First Prize in Fujian Province (2014 & 2016) during junior and senior high schools. With the help of these awards, I am honor to obtain early admission from Independent Recruitment of HIT in 2018.

See my [curriculum vitae page](https://gzn00417.github.io/cv/) or [pdf file](https://gzn00417.github.io/files/CV-GuoZhuoning-20250509.pdf) for more information.
