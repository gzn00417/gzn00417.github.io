Welcome to [Zhuoning Guo (郭茁宁)](https://gzn00417.github.io/) 's homepage!

I'm a $2^{nd}$-year Ph.D. student at [AI Thrust](https://infh.hkust-gz.edu.cn/en/academics/ai), [Information Hub](https://infh.hkust-gz.edu.cn/en), [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou Campus)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Hao Liu (刘浩)](https://raymondhliu.github.io/) and [Prof. Qiang Yang (杨强)](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~qyang/). I received my bachelor degree of software engineering from [Computing Faculty](http://cs.hit.edu.cn/), [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/), at June, 2022. My research interests include data mining, federated learning, and graph neural networks.

Before starting my Ph.D. career, I was a research intern at [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/), supervised by [Prof. Hui Xiong](http://datamining.rutgers.edu/) and collaborate with Baidu Talent Intelligence Center, supervised by [Dr. Hengshu Zhu](https://www.zhuhengshu.com/). Moreover, I was a research intern at DKI Group, [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/) supervised by [Dr. Shizhao Sun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E8%AF%97%E6%98%AD-%E5%AD%99-771b42141/), and a research assistant at [HIT-DBLab](http://db.hit.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Hongzhi Wang](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wang). I also did research with [Prof. Jia Li](https://sites.google.com/view/lijia) and [Dr. Yu Rong](https://hk.linkedin.com/in/royrong).

During my undergraduate life in HIT, I'm honored as the chairman of [HIT Massive Data Club](http://cs.hit.edu.cn/hlsjjlb/list.htm), captain of Football Team of Computing Faculty, HIT and president of HIT Chess Club.

Here is my latest [curriculum vitae](https://gzn00417.github.io/cv/).
