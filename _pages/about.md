Welcome to Zhuoning Guo's homepage!

I'm an undergraduate at [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/) from 2018. I was a research intern at [MSRA](https://www.msra.cn/) supervised by _Shizhao Sun_, and a research assistant at HIT-DBLab supervised by _Hongzhi Wang_.

Currently, I'm looking for research internship and Ph.D. position.

Here is my latest [CV](https://gzn00417.github.io/cv/).
